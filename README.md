## Data Science Experiment 2
Regression Plots with Pandas and Numpy

Are London winters getting warmer. We are going to check whether the temperatures in London are rising over time. It’s not obvious from the raw data but by plotting a regression line over that data we will be better able to see the trend.

Thanks to Alan Jones that i could come up with my first data science experiment

## Data Science Experiment 3
DSC Expt 3 Data cleaning with Pandas Numpy

Proper data cleaning is the “secret” sauce behind machine learning. Better data beats fancier algorithms…

Garbage in = Garbage out. Plain and Simple! Better data beats fancier algorithms…

Thanks to realpython.org that i could get my hands dirty cleaning the data

## Data Science Experiment 4

Exploratory data analysis for McDonalds Nutrition Menu from Kaggle. Using Magic SQL Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Should you clean your data more? There’s a lot of trial and error, so how do you avoid chasing dead ends? The answer is “Exploratory Analysis.” or simply getting to know your data. Doing this upfront helps you save time and avoid regretting later. Proper exploratory analysis is about answering questions. It's about extracting enough insights from your dataset to course correct before you get lost in the weeds.

## Encoding Comparison Analysis

Label encoder v/s One hot encoder

Typically, any structured dataset includes multiple columns – a combination of numerical as well as categorical variables. A machine can only understand the numbers and not the text. That’s essentially the case with Machine Learning algorithms too.

That’s primarily the reason we need to convert categorical columns to numerical columns so that a machine learning algorithm understands it. This process is called categorical encoding. Categorical encoding is a process of converting categories to numbers.

There are multiple ways of handling Categorical variables. In this notebook, we will see widely used techniques:

Label Encoding

One-Hot Encoding

We will infer the winner by comparing MSE of both the models!!!

## Data Science Experiment 5

#### Professional data scientists usually spend a very large portion of their time on Data Cleaning. Pandas is the definitive library for performing data analysis with Python. In this notebook we will discuss some tips to do data cleaning in a quick and efficient manner

#### We will see the detailed usage of 
1. DataFrame.loc
2. DataFrame.value_counts
