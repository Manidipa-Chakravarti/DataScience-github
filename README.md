## Data Science Experiment 2
Regression Plots with Pandas and Numpy

Are London winters getting warmer. We are going to check whether the temperatures in London are rising over time. Itâ€™s not obvious from the raw data but by plotting a regression line over that data we will be better able to see the trend.

Thanks to Alan Jones that i could come up with my first data science experiment
